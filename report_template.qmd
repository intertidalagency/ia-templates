## Introduction

\*TODO\* Create an example file that demonstrates the formatting and features of your format.

## More Information

You can learn more about controlling the appearance of HTML output here: \<https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-basics.html\>

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
